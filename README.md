CSC-148 Final Project Election Data Analysis Extra Credit
For this project, my partner and I were assigned a series of tasks to give us experience processing and analyzing real-world data using Python.
We got to know and pratice using useful packages such as Pandas and Matplotlib. We were asked to process the U.S. President 1976â€“2016 dataset 
provided by MIT Election Data and Science Lab in 2017, and use the knowledge we have learned in this class to produce some insights. 

These were the tasks that we finished:
1. Find the total number of votes of the country for the election from 2000 to 2016.
2. Compare the number of votes and percentages for Republican to those for Democrat across states you are interested in from 2000 to 2016. We chose to look at Vermont.
3. Find the top 5 states that have the highest supportive rate for Republican and Democrat in 2012 and 2016 elections.
4. Pick a state and track its votes over time for both parties between 1976-2016. We chose to look at New Jersey.
5. Visualize the above statistics, using histogram, pie chart, line chart and other appropriate plots. Be creative of choosing the right graph. 
6. Plot the results of an election year of your choice on a US map (see matplotlib/basemap) with different colors representing R and D. 
7. Open Questions:
Besides the aforementioned tasks, please find TWO other insights that you think they extract valuable and actionable information, and try to interpret these insights.
We chose too look at the top 5 states that have the highest write ins in the 2012 and 2016 elections and to look at the trends of write ins from 1976 to 2016.

This project was completed by Mehdi Daoudi and Supraja Sowmiyanarayanan.
